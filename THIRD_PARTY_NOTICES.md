# Third-party data and resources

AMEL bundles a small number of third-party datasets and biological
networks so that its demo loaders and offline activity inference work
without a network connection. **The AMEL MIT license (see `LICENSE`)
covers only AMEL's own source code, not these resources.** Each remains
under its own upstream license and terms — please cite the original sources
when you use them, and check the upstream terms before any commercial use.

## Bundled demo datasets (`inst/extdata/`)

### `demo_airway_*.csv` — airway
- **Source:** airway smooth-muscle RNA-seq (Himes *et al.* 2014), GEO
  accession GSE52778, distributed as the Bioconductor `airway`
  experiment-data package.
- **Reference:** Himes BE, *et al.* "RNA-Seq transcriptome profiling
  identifies CRISPLD2 as a glucocorticoid responsive gene…" *PLoS ONE* 2014.
  doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0099625
- A subset re-exported as a plain counts + metadata CSV for demonstration.
  Regenerate with `dev/make_demo_airway.R`.

### `demo_tcga_*.csv` — TCGA pan-cancer via GSE62944
- **Source:** TCGA RNA-seq reprocessed by Rahman *et al.* 2015, GEO
  accession GSE62944, distributed via the Bioconductor `GSE62944` package.
  Underlying TCGA data are open-access.
- **Reference:** Rahman M, *et al.* "Alternative preprocessing of RNA-Sequencing
  data in The Cancer Genome Atlas leads to improved analysis results."
  *Bioinformatics* 2015. doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btv377
- A small many-cancer subset re-exported for demonstration. Regenerate with
  `dev/make_demo_tcga.R`.

## Bundled activity networks (`inst/extdata/`)

Both are convenience snapshots retrieved from [OmniPath](https://omnipathdb.org/);
see `data-raw/make_networks.R` for the exact queries. Human only.

### `collectri_human.rds` — CollecTRI transcription-factor regulons
- **Source:** CollecTRI, retrieved from OmniPath with the `license=academic`
  filter.
- **Reference:** Müller-Dott S, *et al.* "Expanding the coverage of regulons
  from high-confidence prior knowledge for accurate estimation of
  transcription factor activities." *Nucleic Acids Research* 2023.
  doi:10.1093/nar/gkad841
- CollecTRI is a **composite** resource; its constituent databases retain
  their own licenses. The `license=academic` filter restricts the download
  to resources that permit academic use. Commercial users must review the
  upstream terms of each constituent resource.

### `progeny_human.rds` — PROGENy pathway footprints
- **Source:** PROGENy model, retrieved from OmniPath.
- **Reference:** Schubert M, *et al.* "Perturbation-response genes reveal
  signaling footprints in cancer gene expression." *Nature Communications*
  2018. doi:10.1038/s41467-017-02391-6
- PROGENy is distributed under the **Apache License 2.0**.

## Notes

- These files are snapshots for convenience and reproducibility. To rebuild
  them from the upstream sources, run `data-raw/make_networks.R` (networks)
  and `dev/make_demo_airway.R` / `dev/make_demo_tcga.R` (demos).
- Mouse and rat activity inference still fetch networks live from OmniPath;
  only the human snapshots are bundled.
- If you redistribute AMEL, keep this notice and consult each resource's
  current upstream license before commercial use.
