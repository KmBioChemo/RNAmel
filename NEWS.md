# AMEL 0.17.0 (2026-09-17)

## Project rename

- The package and repository were renamed from **RNAflow** to **AMEL**
  (Auditable Modular Expression Laboratory) to avoid a name clash with an
  unrelated published Nextflow RNA-seq pipeline. The saved-project format
  (`.rnaflow.rds`) is unchanged, so existing sessions load as before.

## New features

- The reproducible R script export now emits a regulator / pathway activity
  step (decoupleR `run_activity()` with `get_tf_network()` /
  `get_pathway_network()`), reflecting the settings recorded in the session.

# AMEL 0.16.7 (2026-08-05)

## Bug fixes

- `read_de_results()` now returns the *validated* table, so character-typed
  numeric columns are properly coerced (the coerced copy was previously
  discarded and the raw table returned).
- Saving a project now captures the full session -- transcription-factor /
  pathway activity, GSVA signatures and the AI interpretation -- not only
  enrichment and WGCNA; restoring a project brings every slot back.
- The all-pairwise shrinkage checkbox no longer labels its estimator as
  `apeglm` (that path uses `normal` shrinkage; the estimator actually used is
  recorded per contrast).
- Differential-expression designs with non-syntactic column names (e.g.
  `batch id`) no longer break the model formula, in the app and in the
  exported R script.

## Input validation

- `validate_counts()` rejects empty (all-zero) sample columns, matching its
  documented behaviour.
- `validate_metadata()` rejects empty or missing sample identifiers.
- `validate_de_results()` errors on non-numeric values in numeric columns
  instead of silently coercing them to `NA`.

## Reproducibility & reporting

- The normalization method actually used (VST, or the `log2(counts + 1)`
  fallback when VST fails) is recorded in the saved project and surfaced in
  the Methods text; the fallback notification is now persistent.
- The Methods paragraph no longer describes every contrast with the first
  contrast's parameters, and states that reported software versions reflect
  the report-generation environment.
- The exported R script uses unique object names, defines uploaded contrasts
  via a real `read_de_results()` call, escapes interpolated strings, reflects
  the `log2` fallback, and notes the steps it does not reproduce.

## Documentation & metadata

- Corrected the TCGA demonstration-dataset citation (Rahman *et al.* 2015).
- Added `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` (airway, TCGA / GSE62944, CollecTRI, PROGENy)
  and `SECURITY.md`; added the maintainer ORCID to the package metadata.
- Exported `assemble_project()` and `contrast_store_upsert()` and fixed the
  getting-started vignette to use the public API.
- Reframed the project roadmap and softened the "validation" wording to
  "consistency and regression checks"; standardised on "downstream".

## Infrastructure

- `R-CMD-check` now runs on pushes to `main` and across an R version matrix
  (release + oldrel-1, exercising the declared R >= 4.4 minimum).

# AMEL 0.16.6 (2026-08-04)

## Feature

- **Duplicate gene IDs are handled automatically.** Real count matrices often
  contain duplicated gene symbols (several Ensembl IDs mapping to one symbol).
  Instead of rejecting the upload, `read_counts()` now merges duplicated gene
  IDs — by summing their per-sample counts by default (kept integer and
  library-size preserving), or keeping the most-expressed row
  (`duplicate_action = "max"`). Strict rejection is still available with
  `duplicate_action = "reject"`. The app shows a notification stating how many
  gene IDs were merged.

# AMEL 0.16.5 (2026-08-02)

## Fix

- **Activity inference works offline.** Human CollecTRI (transcription-factor
  regulons) and PROGENy (pathway footprints) networks are now bundled with the
  package (`inst/extdata/*.rds`). `get_tf_network()` / `get_pathway_network()`
  still try a live OmniPath download first, but fall back to these copies when
  the fetch fails — so TF / pathway activity no longer breaks when the OmniPath
  web service (or its broken offline fallback) is unreachable. Only human is
  bundled; mouse / rat still require the live fetch. `data-raw/make_networks.R`
  documents how the snapshots are generated.

## Documentation

- **README from-scratch install.** Added a step-by-step "Installation from
  scratch (never used R)" section covering installing R, RStudio, the required
  system libraries, Bioconductor dependencies, and launching the app, for users
  starting with nothing installed.

# AMEL 0.16.4 (2026-07-22)

## Feature

- **One-click demo datasets.** The *Data input* panel gains **Airway** and
  **TCGA pan-cancer** buttons that load the bundled demo counts and metadata
  through the same validated readers as an upload. The files are resolved with
  `system.file()`, so they work from an installed package — previously the
  landing text pointed at an `inst/extdata/` folder that does not exist after
  `install_github()`.

# AMEL 0.16.3 (2026-07-03)

## Change

- `fig_gsva_heatmap()` gains a `show_samples` argument. Per-sample (column)
  labels are now hidden by default for large cohorts (> 40 samples), where long
  sample identifiers were illegible and the group annotation already identifies
  the columns; small cohorts still show labels.

# AMEL 0.16.2 (2026-07-03)

## Fix

- **QC gene selector.** Force-hide the native `<select>` that selectize
  replaces (`.selectized { display:none }`), so the gene field no longer shows
  a second empty box stacked under the widget.

# AMEL 0.16.1 (2026-07-03)

## Fixes

- **PCA label toggle now actually hides labels.** Setting `show_labels =
  FALSE` omits the on-plot text data entirely (not just the plotly mode), so
  unchecking *Show sample labels* reliably clears the names in PCA / UMAP / 3D.
- **Stylesheet cache-busting.** The `rnaflow.css` link now carries a `?v=`
  version query so browsers fetch the current stylesheet instead of a stale
  cached copy (the selectize dropdown fix from 0.16.0 was being masked by the
  browser cache).

# AMEL 0.16.0 (2026-07-03)

## UI feedback: PCA labels, all-pairwise DE, cleaner dropdowns

- **PCA sample labels toggle.** The PCA tab gains a *Show sample labels*
  checkbox; `fig_pca()` / `fig_umap()` / `fig_pca_3d()` gain a `show_labels`
  argument (hover tooltips are always available). Declutters large sample sets
  such as the 120-sample TCGA demo.
- **All pairwise DESeq2 comparisons.** New `run_deseq2_all_pairs()` fits the
  model once and extracts every pairwise contrast of the design variable,
  adding each to the multi-contrast store -- far faster than one fit per pair.
  A *Run all pairwise comparisons* checkbox in the DE panel exposes it,
  alongside the existing specific-contrast choice.
- **Dropdown fix.** The selectize dropdown menu was transparent and bled onto
  the controls below; it is now opaque, elevated (z-index + shadow), with an
  accent hover state.

# AMEL 0.15.2 (2026-07-03)

## Fix

- Raise the Shiny file-upload cap from the 5 MB default to 200 MB in
  `app_server()`. Real RNA-seq count matrices -- and the bundled TCGA demo
  (~9 MB) -- exceeded the default, so uploads failed with "Maximum upload
  size exceeded". The previous option value is restored on app stop.

# AMEL 0.15.1 (2026-07-03)

## Complex demo dataset

- Replaced the interim Pickrell subset with a **complex, many-group** second
  demo: a **TCGA pan-cancer** subset (GSE62944; Rahman *et al.* 2015) of
  **8 molecularly distinct cancer types × 15 tumors = 120 samples**
  (BRCA, LUAD, KIRC, LGG, THCA, PRAD, COAD, SKCM; gene symbols). Alongside the
  simple airway set, this shows the tool's power -- cancer types separate
  sharply in PCA / UMAP, WGCNA recovers type-specific modules, and the 8-level
  `cancer_type` factor drives rich multi-contrast comparison and per-sample
  signatures. Built by `dev/make_demo_tcga.R` from ExperimentHub.
- Tests, README, and the Data-tab guidance updated accordingly.
- The TCGA counts file is ~9 MB, so `R CMD check` reports an installed-size
  NOTE -- acceptable for a GitHub-hosted demo (the package is not bound for
  CRAN).

# AMEL 0.15.0 (2026-07-03)

## Publication readiness & repository hygiene (no new features)

- **Bundled data is now two real, published human datasets**, and nothing else:
  **airway** (Himes *et al.* 2014; gene symbols) and a balanced female-vs-male
  subset of **Pickrell *et al.* 2010** (`tweeDEseqCountData`; Ensembl IDs, which
  also exercises the ID → symbol mapping). Removed the simulated sets
  (`demo_counts`, `demo_multi`) and project-specific files (`mrl_lpr_*`,
  `Book*.xlsx`). Each dataset has a `dev/make_demo_*.R` build script.
- **Tests rewired to the real data**: DE/shrinkage on airway, demo-data
  validation on both sets. The module-enrichment test is now a *deterministic*
  real-gene-set example (two Hallmark sets → two modules → GO enrichment),
  removing the dependency on a bundled simulated dataset.
- **Reproducible reference analysis**: the *Getting started* vignette now
  **executes** its core (load → validate → DESeq2 → volcano) on the bundled
  airway data, so a reader can reproduce a real result end to end.
- **Community & citation files** for open-source practice: `CITATION.cff`,
  `inst/CITATION`, `codemeta.json`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and
  GitHub issue templates.
- **Docs**: DESCRIPTION and README describe the full current scope and cite both
  demo datasets with their sources.

# AMEL 0.14.2 (2026-07-03)

## Stabilization pass (no new features)

- **Signatures project state.** `empty_project()` / `assemble_project()` gained
  a canonical `signatures` slot; a Signatures run now records collection,
  method, organism, group-by, top-sets / set & sample counts, size filters,
  timestamp, and the (small) score matrix under `settings$signatures` (was the
  ad-hoc `settings$gsva`, which is still read as a fallback). `load_project()`
  backfills the slot for older `.rnaflow.rds` files. Previously GSVA runs were
  not persisted into saved projects at all.
- **Report & reproducible script.** When a Signatures run is recorded, the HTML
  report adds a concise Signatures section (settings + the saved score heatmap,
  or a note to recompute if the matrix wasn't stored), and `generate_r_script()`
  emits runnable `get_gene_sets()` / `run_gsva()` / `fig_gsva_heatmap()` code.
- **Session manifest.** `session_manifest()` now lists the v0.14 dependencies
  (GSVA, uwot, visNetwork, ggalluvial, ggbeeswarm, ggdist) alongside the rest.
- **Integration test.** `test-shiny-app.R` asserts all 14 tabs, including
  Signatures (still guarded; skips without Chrome/chromote).
- **Docs & hygiene.** DESCRIPTION and README describe the full current scope
  (Explore, QC, Compare, Activity, Signatures, AI, UMAP / 3D PCA). The
  project-specific `mrl_lpr_*` source CSVs are build-ignored (not bundled demo
  data). No runtime logs or temp files are tracked.

# AMEL 0.14.1 (2026-07-03)

## Visual refinements & per-tab explanations

- **Navbar tab icons.** Every tab gains a distinct, recessive Font Awesome icon
  (bright on the active/hovered tab) for faster orientation and a more
  product-like navbar.
- **Unified interactive-plot typography.** New internal `amel_plotly()` helper
  applies the app's font (Inter) and ink colour plus a clean hover label to all
  interactive figures (volcano, PCA, UMAP, 3D PCA, linked Explore), so they read
  as one system instead of plotly defaults.
- **"Why this analysis?" panels.** `ui_page_header()` gained an `about` argument
  rendered as a collapsible native `<details>` panel. All 11 analysis tabs
  (Volcano, Explore, Heatmap, PCA, QC, Compare, Enrichment, Network, Activity,
  Signatures, AI) now carry a short explanation of *why* the analysis matters
  and how to read it -- present but collapsed by default, so no clutter.

# AMEL 0.14.0 (2026-07-02)

## New analyses & visualizations (backlog features)

Four backlog items, each following the pure/impure rule (tested pure
functions + thin module wiring). All new dependencies are Suggests and guarded.

- **UMAP + 3D PCA.** New `compute_umap()` / `fig_umap()` (via \pkg{uwot}) and
  `fig_pca_3d()` (interactive PC1/PC2/PC3). The PCA tab gains an *Embedding*
  selector (PCA 2D / PCA 3D / UMAP) with UMAP neighbour/min-distance controls.
  UMAP is deterministic (seeded, RNG restored).
- **Interactive enrichment network.** `fig_enrich_visnet()` renders the
  enrichment map as a draggable \pkg{visNetwork} widget (hover tooltips,
  neighbour highlighting), reusing the same shared-gene Jaccard graph as the
  static map. Added as an *Interactive map* view on the Enrichment tab (guarded
  so the tab degrades gracefully without visNetwork).
- **Distribution figures.** `fig_gene_expression()` plots a gene's normalized
  expression across groups as a raincloud / beeswarm / box (via \pkg{ggdist} /
  \pkg{ggbeeswarm}) -- wired into the QC tab with a gene selector.
  `contrast_direction_table()` + `fig_contrast_alluvial()` show Up/NS/Down gene
  flow across contrasts (via \pkg{ggalluvial}) -- added to the Compare tab.
- **Per-sample signatures (GSVA / ssGSEA).** New `run_gsva()` (via \pkg{GSVA})
  turns counts into a sets x samples score matrix; `fig_gsva_heatmap()` draws
  the annotated signature heatmap. A new **Signatures** tab scores samples
  against an MSigDB collection; counts are mapped to gene symbols first
  (`gsva_symbol_counts()`), matching the enrichment path so Ensembl/ENTREZ
  projects score correctly.
- **Tests.** +44 tests (embeddings, visNetwork map, gene/alluvial, GSVA):
  422 pass / 0 fail / 1 skip (shinytest2). `pkgdown::check_pkgdown()` clean.

# AMEL 0.13.0 (2026-07-02)

## Reproducibility, distribution, UI finish, integration tests

- **Docker.** New `Dockerfile` (+ `.dockerignore`) pinning R 4.5 /
  Bioconductor 3.22, layer-caching the heavy dependency stack and serving the
  app on `0.0.0.0:8080` -- the primary reproducibility guarantee for this
  Bioconductor-heavy app. `dev/make_renv_lock.R` adds an optional CRAN/Bioc
  version pin on top. README documents the Docker workflow.
- **Distribution.** Confirmed the existing CI already ships the app: pkgdown
  deploys to GitHub Pages on release, R-CMD-check runs on push. (Making the
  repository public and a hosted live demo are left to the maintainer -- a
  static shinylive demo is not feasible because the app depends on compiled
  Bioconductor packages.)
- **UI finish.** Standardised the remaining ad-hoc inline-styled warning
  banners to the shared `ui_banner(type = "warning")` helper (PCA, Heatmap,
  Explore); added `ui_page_header()` with one-line microcopy to the tabs whose
  one-word label under-describes them (Explore, Compare, QC, Network,
  Activity).
- **Integration tests.** New `test-shiny-app.R`: a guarded `shinytest2` smoke
  test that launches the real app headlessly and asserts the brand, all 13
  tabs, and the fresh-launch getting-started guidance render. Skips cleanly
  where Chrome/chromote is unavailable; `shinytest2` added to Suggests.
- **Tests.** 378 pass / 0 fail / 1 skip (the shinytest2 test, without a
  browser). `R CMD check` clean; `pkgdown::check_pkgdown()` clean.

# AMEL 0.12.0 (2026-07-02)

## Professional UI / visual overhaul (no new analyses)

A design-system pass to make AMEL look and feel like a polished scientific
platform. No biological analyses, tabs, or statistics changed.

- **Assets now actually load.** `inst/app/www` was never registered as a Shiny
  resource path, so the stylesheet 404'd and *none* of the app styling applied.
  Added `R/zzz.R` (`.onLoad` -> `addResourcePath("rnaflow", ...)`) and the UI now
  links `rnaflow/rnaflow.css`.
- **Design system.** New token-based stylesheet (`inst/app/www/rnaflow.css`):
  calm teal accent, white/light surfaces, soft cards with hairline borders and
  subtle shadows, consistent typography, spacing, focus rings, and status
  colours. Restyled navbar (active-tab highlight), sidebar, form controls,
  sliders, buttons (clear primary vs secondary), accordions, banners, empty
  states, stat tiles, DataTables, and interactive-plot containers.
- **Navbar.** The active-contrast selector is now a clean pill with a labelled
  caption; brand wordmark refreshed.
- **Reusable components.** New `R/ui_components.R`: `ui_banner()`,
  `ui_empty_state()`, `ui_page_header()`, `ui_stat_tile()` -- consistent
  presentational primitives (pure view helpers, no server logic).
- **Figure theme.** `theme_exploration()` refined for a publication-grade,
  consistent look (subtle horizontal guides, softer axes, muted captions,
  faceted-strip styling); `theme_publication()` gained caption/strip styling.
  Plotted data and thresholds are unchanged; PNG/PDF/TIFF export is unaffected.
- **HTML report.** Redesigned self-contained report: gradient header block,
  overview stat cards, striped tables, dark code blocks, figure captions, and
  tightened section spacing. Still htmltools-only (no pandoc/Quarto),
  reproducible script + session info + AI caveats/provenance preserved.
- **Tests.** New `test-ui-components.R`; 378 pass / 0 fail / 0 skip. App boots
  headless with the stylesheet served (verified), `pkgdown::check_pkgdown()`
  clean.

# AMEL 0.11.4 (2026-07-02)

## Bug-fix pass (multi-agent code review, no new features)

- **AI tab (Haiku 4.5).** `call_claude()` sent `thinking = {type: "adaptive"}`
  for every model, but adaptive thinking is a Claude 4.6+ feature -- Haiku 4.5
  (offered as the "cheapest" option) rejected it with HTTP 400, so that model
  was unusable. The thinking config is now model-aware (adaptive for 4.6+;
  `{type: "enabled", budget_tokens}` for older models).
- **DESeq2.** `run_deseq2()` now fails fast with a clear message when a counts
  sample has no metadata row, instead of a cryptic base-R "missing values in
  'row.names'" crash (validation previously only warned).
- **WGCNA module-trait.** `build_traits()` no longer crashes on metadata with
  `NA` annotation values -- indicator columns are built manually so every
  column keeps one row per sample (NA traits stay NA, which `cor(use = "p")`
  tolerates).
- **WGCNA module enrichment.** `enrich_modules()` now converts Ensembl/ENTREZ
  IDs to symbols (new `ids_to_symbols()` helper) before ORA, matching the DE
  tab; previously module enrichment silently returned nothing for non-symbol
  projects.
- **Enrichment dotplot.** Guarded `-log10(padj)` with `+ 1e-300` so a term with
  an underflowed `padj == 0` is no longer silently dropped from the dotplot
  (the bar and module plots already did this).
- **PCA.** `compute_pca()` now centers only (`scale. = FALSE`), matching
  `DESeq2::plotPCA` and the bulk RNA-seq convention, so the selected
  high-variance genes drive the projection.
- **Project load.** `load_project()` backfills any slots added in newer
  versions from `empty_project()`, so projects saved by older releases load
  with the canonical structure.
- **Interactive volcano.** Legend position "None" now actually hides the legend
  (was only parked off-canvas).
- **KEGG ORA.** `enrichKEGG` results now get `setReadable()` so the `geneID`
  column is gene symbols, consistent with GO / Reactome (which use
  `readable = TRUE`).
- **read_counts.** Duplicate / empty gene IDs now raise the friendly validator
  message instead of a cryptic base-R "duplicate 'row.names'" error (the
  rownames were assigned before validation).
- **Recent-projects cache.** `cache_recent_project()` appends a stable name
  hash to the filename so two display names that sanitise identically no longer
  overwrite each other's cache entry.
- **Activity errors.** The CollecTRI / PROGENy fetch errors now name the
  organism and acknowledge that a failure can be an unsupported organism in the
  installed decoupleR / OmnipathR, not only an OmniPath outage.
- **Tests.** 364 pass / 0 fail / 0 skip on R 4.5.2 / Bioconductor 3.22 (Activity
  tests run for real -- decoupleR + OmnipathR available).

# AMEL 0.11.3 (2026-07-02)

## Consolidation pass (stabilization, no new features)

- **Project state.** Added an `activity` slot to `empty_project()` /
  `assemble_project()`; the Activity tab now records its run (type, method,
  ranking, organism, result table) into the shared settings, alongside the AI
  interpretation, so a saved project keeps them. Older `.rnaflow.rds` files
  without the new slots still load and render (tested).
- **AI provenance.** A saved interpretation now records model, timestamp,
  `top_n`, `n_terms`, `use_enrich`, token usage and estimated cost (never the
  API key). The report's AI section shows this provenance and keeps the
  "hypothesis-generating, may be wrong" caveat.
- **Report/script consistency.** `session_manifest()` now lists plotly,
  crosstalk, httr2, decoupleR and OmnipathR. Corrected the report's outdated
  wording that claimed downstream steps always use default parameters -- it now
  states that recorded settings are used when available.
- **Dependency messages.** Filled in missing "install with ..." hints for the
  plotly, fgsea (curve) and WGCNA guards so every optional-dependency error
  says exactly what to install.
- **Tests.** Added an OmniPath-free `run_activity()` multivariate (mlm) test on
  a synthetic pathway network, plus project-state tests for the new slots and
  backward compatibility (351 tests pass; full `R CMD check` clean).

# AMEL 0.11.2 (2026-07-02)

## Activity inference: honest errors + declared OmnipathR dependency

- **Real root cause of the "broken Activity tab" surfaced.** `decoupleR`
  delegates its CollecTRI / PROGENy network downloads to **OmnipathR**, but only
  *Suggests* it -- so a `decoupleR`-only install (as produced by the old
  `install_deps.R`) left both TF and pathway activity failing. The failure was
  further masked: the `tryCatch` in `get_tf_network()` /
  `get_pathway_network()` rewrote *every* error as "OmniPath temporarily
  unavailable", hiding a missing package or a client-side version clash (old
  OmnipathR vs. modern strict-join dplyr).
- **`get_tf_network()` / `get_pathway_network()` now check for OmnipathR
  explicitly** (with an install hint) and **append the underlying error** to
  their message instead of blaming a server outage unconditionally.
- **`OmnipathR` added to `Suggests`** so the dependency is declared and
  installed by `dev/install_deps.R`.
- **`dev/install_deps.R` raises the download timeout to 3600 s** so large
  Bioconductor annotation packages (e.g. `reactome.db`, ~455 MB) fetch reliably
  on a fresh machine.

# AMEL 0.11.1 (2026-07-01)

## Robust activity-network fetching

- `get_tf_network()` / `get_pathway_network()` now catch OmniPath fetch
  failures (and empty results) and raise a clear, actionable message
  ("OmniPath temporarily unavailable -- retry later / use pathway activity")
  instead of a cryptic upstream tidyselect error. Validated end-to-end: PROGENy
  pathway activity on the airway demo recovers the expected steroid /
  anti-inflammatory signal (Androgen up; NFkB / TNFa / JAK-STAT down).

# AMEL 0.11.0 (2026-07-01)

## Linked interactive explorer (crosstalk)

- **New "Explore" tab** (`mod_linked`, `fig_linked.R`). A \pkg{crosstalk}-linked
  volcano (\pkg{plotly}) and DE table: brush a box or lasso on the volcano and
  the table filters to your selection; the chosen genes are echoed as a
  copyable list and downloadable as a `.txt`. Toggle Up / Down / NS from the
  legend.
- **Pure core.** `linked_volcano_df()` (significance-categorized tidy frame)
  and `fig_linked_volcano()` are Shiny-free and tested.
- `crosstalk` added to `Imports` (already pulled in by \pkg{plotly}).

# AMEL 0.10.0 (2026-07-01)

## TF & pathway activity inference (decoupleR)

- **New "Activity" tab** (`mod_activity`, `analysis_decoupler.R`,
  `fig_decoupler.R`). Instead of "which genes changed", it asks "which upstream
  regulators / pathways best explain the change": transcription-factor activity
  from **CollecTRI** regulons (univariate linear model) and pathway activity
  from **PROGENy** (multivariate), scored against the ranked DE statistic with
  \pkg{decoupleR}. Diverging bar chart of activated / repressed regulators plus
  a sortable table.
- **Pure core.** `activity_input()`, `run_activity()` and `fig_activity_bar()`
  are Shiny-free and tested; only `get_tf_network()` / `get_pathway_network()`
  reach OmniPath. Networks are cached per session.
- `decoupleR` added to `Suggests` (guarded with a clear install message).

# AMEL 0.9.1 (2026-07-01)

## AI narrative in the HTML report

- The AI interpretation is now archived in the standalone HTML report
  (`build_report_html`): the latest narrative is threaded through `settings_rv`
  -> `assemble_project()` -> the report as a rendered "AI interpretation"
  section, so a saved/exported report carries the interpretation alongside the
  reproducible script.

# AMEL 0.9.0 (2026-07-01)

## AI-assisted biological interpretation

- **New "AI" tab** (`mod_ai`, `ai_interpret.R`). Sends a compact summary of the
  active contrast -- the top up/down gene names with their fold-changes and
  FDRs, plus the latest enrichment terms -- to Anthropic's Claude API and
  renders the returned biological narrative (summary, up/down programs,
  pathway interpretation, caveats & follow-up). The count matrix and sample
  metadata are never transmitted.
- **Pure, testable core.** `build_interpret_prompt()`, `summarize_de_for_ai()`,
  `summarize_enrich_for_ai()` and `estimate_cost()` build the prompt and cost
  estimate with no network access; `call_claude()` is the only function that
  touches the API (thin `httr2` wrapper, guarded by `requireNamespace`).
- **Key handling.** The Anthropic API key is read from a session-only password
  field or the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable -- never written to
  disk or logged. The feature degrades gracefully when no key is present.
- **Model choice.** Claude Opus 4.8 (default), Sonnet 5, or Haiku 4.5, with a
  live token/cost estimate. `httr2` added to `Suggests`.

# AMEL 0.8.1 (2026-07-01)

## "Restrict to active contrast" on Heatmap and PCA

- The Heatmap and PCA tabs now have a **"Restrict to active contrast groups"**
  checkbox. When ticked, only the samples of the two groups in the active
  contrast are shown (via `restrict_to_contrast()`); unticked keeps the
  previous behavior of showing all samples. This clarifies that DESeq2 fits
  the model on all samples for dispersion, while you can choose whether the
  visualizations display the whole dataset or just the compared groups.

# AMEL 0.8.0 (2026-07-01)

## QC diagnostics, gene-ID auto-mapping, Methods generator

- **QC / Diagnostics tab** (`mod_qc`, `fig_qc.R`): p-value histogram (model
  calibration), MA plot, sample-sample correlation heatmap, and library-size
  bar chart -- standard checks to run before interpreting results.
- **Automatic gene-ID conversion.** The Enrichment tab now detects Ensembl or
  ENTREZ identifiers and maps them to gene symbols (`map_de_to_symbols()`,
  `guess_id_type()`), collapsing duplicates, so enrichment works regardless of
  the input ID type.
- **Methods paragraph generator** (`generate_methods_text()`): a prose summary
  of the analysis naming the tools, their versions, and the exact parameters
  used -- downloadable from the Report tab, ready to adapt for a manuscript.

# AMEL 0.7.3 (2026-07-01)

## Real published demo dataset (airway)

- Added **`demo_airway_*.csv`**: the published `airway` dataset (Himes et al.
  2014) -- human airway smooth muscle cells, dexamethasone vs. control across
  4 cell lines (8 samples, ~17k genes, gene symbols). It complements the
  simulated demos and exercises real biology, covariate adjustment (`cell`),
  and enrichment (glucocorticoid response). Built by `dev/make_demo_airway.R`
  (Ensembl -> symbol mapping, duplicate collapse, low-count filter).
- Tests validate all three bundled demo datasets load and validate cleanly.
- README, vignette and the app's "Getting started" card document the demos.
- `airway` is only used by the (build-ignored) generator script, so it is not
  a package dependency.

# AMEL 0.7.2 (2026-07-01)

## Audit polish

- **`run_deseq2()` no longer coerces every design variable to a factor.**
  Character / logical / factor columns become factors (categorical), but
  numeric covariates stay numeric so they enter the model as continuous
  adjustments; the contrast variable is always treated as a factor. Added a
  test for numeric-covariate preservation.
- **`run_wgcna()` sets `TOMType` consistently with `networkType`** (unsigned
  network -> unsigned TOM), preserving the user's choice.
- **Clarified `run_deseq2()` docs**: shrinkage affects only the effect-size
  estimates; inference stays the unshrunken Wald test; the default GSEA
  ranking by `stat` therefore uses the unshrunken Wald statistic.
- **`generate_r_script()` header** now states that enrichment / WGCNA use the
  recorded settings when available and example defaults otherwise.

# AMEL 0.7.1 (2026-07-01)

## Exact reproducibility & remaining audit items

- **Exact parameter capture.** The Enrichment and Network tabs now record the
  settings they were run with (GSEA/ORA collection, ranking metric, database,
  thresholds; WGCNA gene count, network type, power, module parameters). These
  are saved in the project and emitted verbatim by `generate_r_script()`, so
  the exported script reproduces the *exact* analysis (not just a template).
  Loading a project restores these settings too.
- **WGCNA quality control.** `wgcna_datexpr()` now runs
  `WGCNA::goodSamplesGenes()` and removes flagged genes / samples (with a
  message).
- **GSEA ties.** `run_gsea()` warns when the ranking metric has tied values
  (and muffles fgsea's redundant internal warning).

# AMEL 0.7.0 (2026-07-01)

## Methodological fixes (scientific audit)

- **Inference vs. shrinkage separation (fixes a GSEA crash).** `run_deseq2()`
  now always takes `stat` / `pvalue` / `padj` from the unshrunken Wald test
  and overlays only the shrunken `log2FoldChange` / `lfcSE`. Previously,
  apeglm shrinkage (the default) dropped the `stat` column, so the default
  GSEA ranking (`rank_by = "stat"`) errored. The estimator actually used is
  recorded in `attr(result, "shrink")` and shown in the DE tab.
- **Covariate / batch adjustment in the app.** The DE tab now has an optional
  "Adjust for" selector; the variable of interest stays the last design term
  so contrasts are unchanged, while covariates (e.g. batch) enter the model.
- **Multiple-testing correction for module-trait correlations.**
  `module_trait_cor()` now returns BH-adjusted `padj`; `fig_module_trait()`
  shows correlation with FDR significance stars.
- **Transparent shrinkage fallback.** When apeglm cannot be used for a given
  contrast (its coefficient is not in the model), the switch to `normal`
  shrinkage is now reported rather than silent.
- **WGCNA soft-power fallback.** When the scale-free fit does not reach the
  target (common at small sample sizes), `wgcna_pick_power()` falls back to
  WGCNA's sample-size-based default and flags it on the plot.
- **Reproducibility.** The R-script export records each contrast's covariates;
  the HTML report now embeds full `sessionInfo()`. Both clarify that
  downstream (enrichment/WGCNA) steps use default parameters.

# AMEL 0.6.2 (2026-07-01)

## Stabilization & pre-release polish

- Verified that all app tabs open cleanly from an empty state (Data, Volcano,
  Heatmap, PCA, Compare, Enrichment, Network, Project, Report) and that the
  figure / table / project / script / report export buttons are wired.
- Softened promotional wording in documentation and code comments (removed
  "Nature-style" / "high-impact" phrasing in favor of neutral, sober terms).
- Added a **Limitations** section to the README (bulk RNA-seq only; no FASTQ
  processing; not a substitute for expert statistical review; WGCNA and
  enrichment results are exploratory and need validation).
- Network tab shows a brief, non-blocking note that WGCNA is more reliable
  with larger sample sizes.
- No new features, dependencies, or breaking changes; project file format is
  unchanged (backward compatible).

# AMEL 0.6.1 (2026-07-01)

## Module enrichment visualizations (WGCNA)

- **`enrich_modules()`**: runs ORA on every co-expression module (reusing the
  phase-3 enrichment layer) and returns a combined tidy table.
- **`fig_module_enrichment()`**: a modules x pathways dotplot
  (compareCluster-style) — dot size = gene count, color = -log10(FDR),
  module axis labels colored by their WGCNA color (via ggtext). Shows each
  module's biological identity at a glance.
- Network tab: the module-enrichment card now shows a **dotplot** for the
  selected module ("This module") and a cross-module comparison
  ("All modules"), in addition to the table. New Suggests: ggtext.

# AMEL 0.6.0 (2026-07-01)

## Additional visualizations

- **Enrichment map** (`fig_enrich_map`): enriched pathways drawn as a network,
  linked by shared genes (Jaccard), nodes colored by NES (GSEA) or
  -log10(FDR) (ORA) and sized by set size. Built on ggraph / igraph.
- **GSEA ridgeline** (`fig_gsea_ridge`): stacked density ridges of the gene
  ranking metric per top pathway, colored by NES. Built on ggridges.
- **WGCNA module network** (`fig_module_network`): a module's co-expression
  network with hub genes at the center, sized/colored by module membership
  (kME). Built on ggraph.
- **Enhanced volcano**: optional `glow` halo on significant genes.
- **Palette system** (`fig_palettes`): a qualitative palette plus
  perceptually-uniform continuous scales (via scico, viridis fallback) used
  across the new figures.
- Wired into the **Enrichment** (map + ridgeline), **Network** (module
  network) and **Volcano** (glow) tabs.
- New Suggests: ggraph, igraph, tidygraph, ggridges, scico.

# AMEL 0.5.1 (2026-07-01)

## Quality pass — clean `R CMD check`

The package now passes `R CMD check` with 0 errors / 0 warnings (the only
NOTE is an environment "unable to verify current time" artifact).

- **Documentation**: generated the full `man/` (123 Rd pages) via roxygen2;
  roxygen now owns `NAMESPACE`.
- **Portability**: replaced all non-ASCII characters in R code with ASCII
  equivalents.
- **Dependencies**: added the actually-used `magrittr`, `htmlwidgets`
  (Imports) and `AnnotationDbi`, `withr`, `apeglm`, `ashr` (Suggests);
  removed 8 unused Imports (golem, config, purrr, tibble, tidyr, readr,
  shinyjs, S4Vectors); pruned unused Suggests.
- **Fixes**: `importFrom(utils, head, tail)`; corrected a broken Rd
  cross-reference; `.Rbuildignore` for `dev/`, `LICENSE.md`;
  fixed the GitHub owner in URLs (`KmBioChemo/AMEL`); cleaned the
  author record.

# AMEL 0.5.0 (2026-07-01)

## Phase 5 — Reproducibility (roadmap complete)

- **Reproducible R script export** (`generate_r_script()`): turns a session
  into a runnable, commented .R script that reproduces the whole pipeline
  (load → DESeq2 per contrast → figures → GSEA/ORA → WGCNA → sessionInfo)
  with AMEL's public API — ready for a Methods section. The output is
  guaranteed to parse.
- **Self-contained HTML report** (`build_report_html()`): a single-file
  report with parameters, a DE summary table, per-contrast volcanoes and the
  cross-contrast signature heatmap embedded as base64, the reproducible
  script, and the package manifest. Built with `htmltools` — no pandoc /
  Quarto toolchain required.
- **Report tab** (`mod_report`): download the .R script or the HTML report,
  preview the script, and view session package versions.
- `assemble_project()` helper shared by the project-manager and report tabs.
- Note: in place of a full `renv` lockfile (renv not present), the report
  embeds a package-version manifest capturing the analysis environment.

# AMEL 0.4.0 (2026-06-30)

## Phase 4 — WGCNA co-expression networks

- **Network tab** (`mod_wgcna`): a guided workflow — pick the soft-threshold
  power, detect modules, then explore module-trait correlations, module
  sizes, eigengene profiles, hub genes, and per-module GO enrichment.
- **Pure layer** (`analysis_wgcna.R`): `wgcna_datexpr()` (top-variance gene
  selection + transpose), `wgcna_pick_power()` (scale-free fit), `run_wgcna()`
  (blockwise modules + eigengenes), `build_traits()`, `module_trait_cor()`,
  `hub_genes()` (signed kME), `module_gene_list()`, `module_summary()`. A
  `with_wgcna_cor()` helper works around WGCNA's `cor` masking so the package
  works without attaching WGCNA.
- **Figures** (`fig_wgcna.R`): `fig_soft_threshold()`, `fig_module_trait()`
  (correlation heatmap), `fig_module_sizes()`, `fig_eigengene()`.
- **Module enrichment reuses phase 3**: hub modules feed `run_ora()` for
  GO Biological Process terms.
- On the demo, modules recover the planted biology — an LPS/inflammation
  module (hub genes Tlr2, Cxcl2, Icam1, Ifih1) tracking treatment, a genotype
  module, and the batch effect isolated into grey.
- Added `WGCNA` (BiocManager) to the environment.

# AMEL 0.3.1 (2026-06-30)

## Enrichment UX

- The Enrichment tab now detects an **organism / species mismatch**: if
  almost none of the DE gene symbols map to the selected organism's
  annotation, it shows a clear message pointing to the Organism setting on
  the Data tab instead of silently returning zero enriched terms.

# AMEL 0.3.0 (2026-06-30)

## Phase 3 — Functional enrichment

- **GSEA** (`run_gsea()`, via `fgsea`) against MSigDB collections
  (`get_gene_sets()`, via `msigdbr`): Hallmark, Reactome / KEGG (C2),
  GO BP/MF/CC (C5). Gene ranking by Wald statistic, signed -log10(p), or
  log2FC (`rank_genes()`).
- **ORA** (`run_ora()`, via `clusterProfiler` / `ReactomePA`) against GO,
  KEGG and Reactome, with automatic symbol→ENTREZ conversion.
- **Per-organism annotation** (`utils_annotation.R`): human / mouse / rat →
  org.Hs/Mm/Rn.eg.db, MSigDB species, KEGG / Reactome organism codes.
- **Figures** (`fig_enrich.R`): enrichment dotplot, -log10(FDR) bar, and the
  GSEA running-enrichment curve — all theme-aware with publication mode.
- **Enrichment tab** (`mod_enrich`): runs GSEA / ORA on the active contrast,
  with results table and figure export.
- **Richer demo**: `dev/make_demo_multi.R` now seeds the planted DE modules
  from real MSigDB Hallmark sets (TNFA/NF-κB, inflammatory & interferon
  responses, OXPHOS, E2F), so the whole pipeline — DE → multi-contrast →
  enrichment — tells one coherent inflammation/rescue story.

# AMEL 0.2.0 (2026-06-30)

## Phase 2 — Project manager + multi-contrast

- **Named contrast store.** Every DESeq2 run is now saved as a named
  contrast (`"<var>: <treated> vs <reference>"`); an active-contrast
  selector in the navbar drives the Volcano / Heatmap / PCA tabs. Uploaded
  pre-computed DE tables are mirrored into the store too.
- **Compare tab.** New multi-contrast views over the store:
  - Venn diagram (`fig_venn()`, via `eulerr`) for 2-4 contrasts
  - UpSet plot (`fig_upset()`, via `ComplexHeatmap`) for any number
  - Side-by-side volcano grid (`fig_volcano_grid()`)
  - log2FoldChange signature heatmap (`fig_lfc_heatmap()`)
  with shared significance thresholds, direction filter, and figure export.
- **Project manager tab.** Save the full session (counts, metadata,
  organism, all contrasts) to a `.rnaflow.rds` file, reload one, and re-open
  recent projects from a per-user cache.
- **New pure functions** (testable, no Shiny): `contrast_sig_genes()`,
  `contrast_sig_sets()`, `contrast_lfc_matrix()`, plus the `fig_compare`
  family and the `save_compare()` exporter.
- Added `eulerr` (Suggests) and `grid` (Imports) dependencies.

# AMEL 0.1.2 (2026-06-30)

## Bug fixes
- Eliminate `Error in &&: 'length = 2000' in coercion to 'logical(1)'`
  in the Volcano tab by replacing fragile multi-clause `&&` chains around
  axis-limit checks (`x_min`, `x_max`, `y_max`) with new helpers
  `is_pos_scalar()` and `is_num_scalar()`. Guarantees the input is a
  finite scalar before any comparison.
- Harden `%||%` to handle NULL, empty, NA, and non-finite numerics
  uniformly; leave longer vectors alone.

# AMEL 0.1.1 (2026-06-30)

## Bug fixes
- Fix `'length = N' in coercion to 'logical(1)'` warnings in the Volcano
  tab (R 4.3+ strict mode). NAs in `padj` / `log2FoldChange` are now
  handled explicitly in regulation classification, both in
  `prep_volcano_data()` and in the volcano module's stats / DE table
  outputs.
- Graceful fallback when `apeglm` is not installed: `run_deseq2()` now
  falls back to `"normal"` shrinkage with an informative message instead
  of throwing.

# AMEL 0.1.0 (2026-06-30)

Initial package-structured release. Refactor of the original `app.R`
single-file Shiny app into a modular R package:

- Pure utility / figure / analysis layer (testable without Shiny)
- 5 Shiny modules (data, DE, volcano, heatmap, PCA)
- Strict input validation with explicit error messages
- DESeq2 integration (auto-contrast, LFC shrinkage)
- Exploration ↔ Publication figure modes
- Project save/load (`.rnaflow.rds`)
- `testthat` test suite
- Demo dataset (2000 genes × 12 samples)
