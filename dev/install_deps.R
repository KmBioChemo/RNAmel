# One-shot dependency installer for RNAmel (cross-platform: Windows / macOS / Linux)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Reads DESCRIPTION and installs every Depends / Imports / Suggests package
# (CRAN *and* Bioconductor) via BiocManager, which resolves both repositories.
# Run this once per machine when setting up the dev environment.
#
# Usage (from the package root, i.e. the folder containing DESCRIPTION):
#   source("dev/install_deps.R")
#
# On Windows you also need Rtools (matching your R version, e.g. Rtools44 for
# R 4.4.x) so packages that need compiling can build. Install it from
# https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/ before running this.
