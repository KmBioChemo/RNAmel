# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in AMEL, please report it **privately**
rather than opening a public issue. Email the maintainer at
**karim.matmat@unibas.ch** with a description and, where possible, steps to
reproduce. You can expect an acknowledgement within a few working days.

## Things to be aware of

AMEL is an interactive analysis application meant to run locally, or on a
server you control. In particular:

- **AI-assisted interpretation is opt-in and sends data to a third party.**
  When you enable it and provide an API key, AMEL sends gene names,
  fold-changes, FDRs and enrichment terms — **but not the raw count matrix** —
  to the Anthropic Claude API. Do **not** enable it for confidential or
  unpublished data that you cannot share with an external API, and be aware
  that on a shared/remote deployment this data leaves the host.
- **Project files execute `readRDS()`.** Opening a `.rnaflow.rds` project
  deserializes an R object; only open project files from sources you trust.
- **API keys** are read from the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable or
  entered in the session and are never written to saved projects or reports.

## Supported versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest release on the `main` branch.
Please update to the latest version before reporting an issue.
