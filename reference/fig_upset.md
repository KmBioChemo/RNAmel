# UpSet plot of significant-gene sets

Intersection plot via ComplexHeatmap's UpSet implementation. Scales to
many contrasts where a Venn diagram cannot.

## Usage

``` r
fig_upset(
  sets,
  min_size = 1,
  sort_by = c("size", "degree"),
  set_size_width = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- sets:

  a named list of character vectors (e.g. from
  [`contrast_sig_sets()`](https://KmBioChemo.github.io/RNAmel/reference/contrast_sig_sets.md))

- min_size:

  minimum intersection size to display

- sort_by:

  order intersections by "size" (default) or "degree"

- set_size_width:

  width (cm) of the set-size bar annotation; `NULL` (default) uses
  ComplexHeatmap's default. Increase it when the set-size bars look
  compressed next to a wide intersection matrix.

## Value

a ComplexHeatmap UpSet object; prints as a figure
